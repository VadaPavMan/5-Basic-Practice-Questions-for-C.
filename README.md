### More Questions
1. Write The Program To Determine Whether The Student Has Passed Or Failed. To pass, a student requires a total of 40% and at least 33% in each subject. Assume there are three subjects and take the marks as input from the user.
   
2. Write The Program To Find Whether The Letter is lowercase or uppercase using ASCII Value. Take a Letter as a input from the user. [ASCII TABLE](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html)

3. Sum of First N Natural Numbers
Write a C program that takes an integer input N and uses a for loop to find the sum of the first N natural numbers.

- For Example
```
Enter a number: 10
Sum of first 10 natural numbers is: 55
```
4. Print a Pattern
Write a C program that uses a for loop to print the following pattern based on a given number of rows.
```
Input: Enter the how many rows you want: 5
Output:
*
**
***
****
*****
```
5. Function Call
Using Functions for Code Modularity: Write a C program that calculates the area of a rectangle and a circle. Create two separate functions: float areaRectangle(float length, float width) and float areaCircle(float radius). Call these functions in your main() function and print the results.

6. Factorial Calculation
Problem: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number n. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120.

7. Fibonacci Sequence
Problem: Write a recursive function to find the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

# Example
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 8 (Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
```

8. Pointer Dereferencing.
Create a pointer that points to a float variable y initialized with 5.5. Print the value of y using both the pointer and the variable name.

9. Swapping Two Numbers: Using Pointers.
Write a function swap(int *a, int *b) that takes two integer pointers as arguments and swaps their values. Use this function in the main() to swap two integers.
